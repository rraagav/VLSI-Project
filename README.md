This is a project in which I demonstrated a 4-bit ALU coded in Verilog, NGSpice, and MAGIC, in my VLSI-Design Course taken in my Second Year, First Semester.

The implementation can perform four important operations on two 4-Bit Numbers:
Addition
Subtraction
Comparator
ANDing both numbers

Inputs:
The input from the user is two 4-Bit Numbers. For the sake of clarity, the select line combinations and their functions are listed below:

Setting S1 = 0 and S0 = 0 performs Addition Operation.

Setting S1 = 0 and S0 = 1 performs Subtraction Operation.

Setting S1 = 1 and S0 = 0 performs Comparator Operation.

Setting S1 = 1 and S0 = 1 performs ANDing Operation.
